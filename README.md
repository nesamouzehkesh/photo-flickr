1) Installing
----------------------------------

First create a Db for this project (for example symfony_basic)
Go to WWW and then type:

    git clone https://github.com/SamanShafigh/felix.git

Then, use the `./install.sh` command to install the application. To do this first give
permission to this file and then run it. It will install all third party vendors, and
creates and populates application tables.
